# events
A site learned from a tutorial using .Next JS. Original Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjY94sAKLlw

This was my first Next JS site. It was built through a tutorial. This site showcases the ability of Next JS to dynamically create pages. 
This is best seen in the different city events where the layout and styles are the same but have different information. 
It also showcases aspects unique to Next JS as opposed to just React. These include built in paths and links, getStaticProps and 
getStaticPaths, page layouts and more. 

There are still some aspects I would like to include in this site. Some of these things include a 
proper login and register form. As it can be seen the event registration is fully functional, 
but basic. It will update the database with information, however it is bare bones and I would like 
to add some more to it including usernames, passwords and authentication. 
With all that said please explore and view the pictures I have provided. 
Thank You.
